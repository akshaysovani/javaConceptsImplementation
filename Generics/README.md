This is a small project implementing generics provided by Java.
The aim of the project is to display teams according to their rankings in all the leagues depending on the rankings. 
Teams will play matches against one another and depending on the wins, losses and tied matches, points are assigned to the teams.

Generics come into play to make sure that the league accepts correct teams. 
Teams include correct players. By 'correct', I mean, a football team should pick only the players who play football. 
Soccer team picks soccer players only. Moreover, Leaugues accept correct teams to play matches. i.e. A league for baseball should pick only those teams who play baseball.

The given project has 3 leagues:
1. Soccer League: UEFA
2. Cricket League: IPL
3. Football League: NFL

Soccer league has 3 teams while other leagues have 2 teams each.
Every team plays a match with every other team in a league and according to wins, losses and draws, the project outputs the teams and their rankings.
